description: MUST use this skill when user asks to commit, create commit, save work, or mentions "커밋". This skill OVERRIDES default git commit behavior. Creates commits following Conventional Commits format with emoji + type/scope/subject (✨ feat, 🐛 fix, ♻️ refactor, etc).
---

# Git Commit Guide

Creates commits using the Conventional Commits format with type, scope, and subject components.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Check project conventions
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | head -30

# 2. Review staged changes
git diff --staged --stat
git diff --staged

# 3. Stage files if needed
git add <files>

# 4. Create commit with emoji
git commit -m "✨ feat(scope): add new feature"
```

## Commit Structure

Format: `emoji type(scope): subject`

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **emoji** | Visual indicator | ✨, 🐛, ♻️ |
| **type** | Change category | `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` |
| **scope** | Affected area (kebab-case) | `auth`, `api-client` |
| **subject** | What changed (imperative mood) | `add login validation` |

**Rules:**
- First line ≤ 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adding")
- No period at end

## Commit Scope (Logical Atomicity)

**MUST FOLLOW:** Do not commit per file. Commit per **feature unit**.

- **Principle:** If you modified `main.py`, `utils.py`, `config.yaml` to develop Feature A, these 3 files **MUST be in a single commit**.
- **Reason:** When reverting to a specific commit, that feature should work completely.

**❌ Bad Example** (파일별로 분리 커밋 - 기능 단위가 아님)
```bash
git add search.py
git commit -m "✨ feat: create search module"
git add api.py
git commit -m "🐛 fix: fix api connection"
```

**✅ Good Example**
```bash
git add search.py api.py
git commit -m "✨ feat(search): implement keyword search with API endpoint"
```

## Result-Oriented Messages

**MUST FOLLOW:** Do not write conversation history (process). Write only the **final code changes (result)**.

Even if there were 10 modifications during development (error fixes, typo fixes, etc.), the commit message should only state the finally implemented feature.

| ❌ Bad (Process) | ✅ Good (Result) |
|------------------|------------------|
| "Fixed typo, fixed A function error, added library to implement login" | `✨ feat(auth): implement JWT-based login` |
| "fix api connection and variable name errors and import errors" | `✨ feat(search): implement keyword search` |

## Core Workflow

### 1. Check Project Conventions

```bash
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

Always check for project-specific commit rules.

### 2. Review Staged Changes

```bash
git diff --staged --stat
git diff --staged
```

Understand what's being committed.

### 3. Analyze Changes

Identify:
- Primary type (feat > fix > refactor)
- Scope (module/component affected)
- Summary (what changed, in imperative mood)

### 4. Create Commit

```bash
git commit -m "emoji type(scope): subject"
# Example: git commit -m "✨ feat(auth): add login validation"
```

### 5. Add Body (if needed)

For complex changes:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
✨ feat(scope): subject

Body explaining WHY and HOW.
Wrap at 72 characters.

Refs: #123
EOF
)"
```

## Breaking Changes

Add exclamation mark (!) after type/scope for breaking changes:

```bash
git commit -m "💥 feat(api)!: change response format"
```

Or use footer:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
💥 feat(api): change response format

BREAKING CHANGE: Response now returns array instead of object.
EOF
)"
```

## Subject Line Rules

- **DO**: Use imperative mood ("add", "fix", "change")
- **DO**: Keep under 50 characters
- **DO**: Start lowercase after colon
- **DON'T**: End with period
- **DON'T**: Use vague words ("update", "improve", "change stuff")

## Review Fix Commits

When addressing PR review comments:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
🐛 fix(scope): address review comment #ID

Brief explanation of what was wrong and how it's fixed.
Addresses review comment #123456789.
EOF
)"
```

## Commit Split Guidelines

When analyzing diffs, consider splitting commits based on:

| Criteria | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Different concerns** | Changes to unrelated parts of codebase |
| **Change types** | Feature vs bug fix vs refactoring |
| **File patterns** | Source code vs documentation vs config |
| **Logical grouping** | Changes easier to review separately |
| **Size** | Very large changes that benefit from granularity |

**Split Example:**
```
1st: ✨ feat: add new solc version type definitions
2nd: 📝 docs: update documentation for new solc version
3rd: 🔧 chore: update package.json dependencies
4th: 🏷️ feat: add type definitions for new API endpoints
5th: 🧵 feat: improve worker thread concurrency handling
6th: 🚨 fix: resolve linting issues in new code
7th: ✅ test: add unit tests for new solc version features
8th: 🔒️ fix: update dependencies for security vulnerabilities
```

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before creating a commit, ask yourself:

1. **Are all related files included?** (Are all dependency files modified for the feature `git add`ed?)
2. **Is the message clean?** (Does it contain only the core implementation without repetitive "fix", "modify"?)
3. **Is it the diff from previous commit?** (Did you summarize `git diff` content, not conversation log?)

## Good Commit Examples

🐛 fix: resolve memory leak in rendering process
📝 docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
♻️ refactor: simplify error handling logic in parser

🦺 feat: add input validation for user registration form
💚 fix: resolve CI pipeline test failures
📈 feat: implement tracking for user engagement analytics
🔒️ fix: strengthen authentication password requirements
♿️ feat: improve form accessibility for screen readers
```

## Important Rules

- **ALWAYS** check project conventions (CLAUDE.md) before committing
- **ALWAYS** review staged changes before committing
- **ALWAYS** commit per feature unit, not per file
- **ALWAYS** write result-oriented messages (final changes only)
- **ALWAYS** use imperative mood in subject ("add", not "added")
- **ALWAYS** include appropriate emoji at the start
- **ALWAYS** keep first line ≤ 72 characters
- **ALWAYS** use HEREDOC for multi-line messages
- **NEVER** stage secrets, credentials, or large binaries
- **NEVER** use vague subjects ("fix bug", "update code")
- **NEVER** list process steps in commit message
- **NEVER** end subject with period
