# Schema Research - Examples

This file contains example research workflows for investigating Schema.org classes and properties.

## Example 1: Research New Class (Recipe)

**User Request:**
> "Research the Recipe class from Schema.org before I add it"

**Research Process:**

### Step 1: Fetch Schema.org Definition
```
WebFetch: https://schema.org/Recipe
Result: Recipe is a subtype of CreativeWork

Description: A recipe. For dietary restrictions covered by the recipe, a few common restrictions are enumerated via suitableForDiet. The keywords property can also be used to add more detail.
```

### Step 2: Analyze Hierarchy
```
Thing → CreativeWork → Recipe

Inherited from Thing (8 properties):
- name, description, url, identifier, image, sameAs, alternateName, disambiguatingDescription

Inherited from CreativeWork (12 properties):
- author, dateCreated, dateModified, genre, headline, keywords, license, publisher, version, etc.

Direct Recipe Properties (15):
- recipeIngredient, recipeInstructions, cookTime, prepTime, totalTime
- recipeYield, recipeCuisine, recipeCategory, nutrition, suitableForDiet
- cookingMethod, ingredients (deprecated, use recipeIngredient)
```

###Step 3: Check Template Status
```bash
# Check if Recipe exists
grep -r ":user.class/Recipe" source/
# Result: Not found

# Check if CreativeWork exists
grep -r "CreativeWork" source/
# Result: Found in source/creative-work/classes.edn

# Check creative-work module
ls source/creative-work/
# Result: classes.edn, properties.edn, README.md
```

### Step 4: Generate Report

```
📚 Schema.org Class Research: Recipe

## Example 3: Validate Property Type Mapping

**User Request:**
> "Should 'birthDate' be :date or :default type in Logseq?"

**Analysis:**

```
🔍 Property Type Validation: birthDate
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Schema.org Definition:
- Property: birthDate
- Expected Type: Date
- Description: Date of birth
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD or DateTime

Logseq Type Options:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Option 1: :date (RECOMMENDED ✅)
- Logseq renders date picker
- Formatted display in UI
- Can query/filter by date
- Supports date calculations
- Better UX for users

Option 2: :default (NOT recommended ❌)
- Plain text entry
- No date picker
- No date formatting
- No date queries
- Manual validation needed

Recommendation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Use: :date
Cardinality: :db.cardinality/one (single birth date)

Definition:
```clojure
:user.property/birthDate-xY9zK
{:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
 :logseq.property/type :date
 :block/title "birthDate"
 :build/property-classes [:user.class/Person-aB1cD]
 :build/properties
 {:logseq.property/icon {:id "🎂" :type :emoji}
  :logseq.property/description "Date of birth"}}
```

Benefits of :date:
1. Native date picker in Logseq UI
2. Standardized date format
3. Can query "show all birthdays this month"
4. Can calculate age automatically
5. Better data quality (prevents "1985" vs "Jan 1985" inconsistencies)

Example Queries Enabled:
```clojure
;; Find birthdays this month
(query (and (page-property birthDate)
            (between birthDate [[this-month]])))

;; Sort people by age
(query (sort-by birthDate :desc))
```
```

## Example 4: Research Property for Multiple Classes

**User Request:**
> "Research the 'location' property - which of our classes should use it?"

**Analysis:**

```
🔍 Property Research: location
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Schema.org Definition:
- Property: location
- Expected Type: Place, PostalAddress, Text, VirtualLocation
- Description: The location of the event, organization, or action
- Cardinality: Can be multiple

Used By (Schema.org):
- Action - Location where action takes place
- Event - Event venue/location
- Organization - Organization's physical location
- InteractionCounter - Location of interaction

Current Template Status:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Check existing classes:
✅ Event - EXISTS in source/event/classes.edn
✅ Organization - EXISTS in source/organization/classes.edn
✅ Action - EXISTS in source/action/classes.edn
❌ InteractionCounter - Not in template

Check if location property exists:
grep -r "location" source/*/properties.edn
Result: ❌ Not found - Need to add

Recommendation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Add location property to: common/properties.edn
(Shared by multiple classes)

Type: :node (links to Place pages)
Cardinality: :db.cardinality/many (events can have multiple locations)

Assign to Classes:
1. Event - Primary use case (event venues)
2. Organization - Office/branch locations
3. Action - Where action occurred

Property Definition:
```clojure
:user.property/location-pQ2rS
{:db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many
 :logseq.property/type :node
 :block/title "location"
 :build/property-classes
 [:user.class/Event-aB1cD
  :user.class/Organization-eF3gH
  :user.class/Action-iJ4kL]
 :build/properties
 {:logseq.property/icon {:id "📍" :type :emoji}
  :logseq.property/description "Physical or virtual location"}}
```

Use Cases:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Event Examples:
- Conference → [[Convention Center]]
- Meeting → [[Office - Room 304]]
- Webinar → [[Virtual - Zoom]]

Organization Examples:
- Company → [[Headquarters]], [[Branch Office]]
- University → [[Main Campus]], [[Satellite Campus]]

Action Examples:
- CreateAction → [[Workshop Studio]]
- TradeAction → [[Marketplace]]

Implementation Steps:
1. Add property to source/common/properties.edn
2. Update Event, Organization, Action classes
3. Create example Place pages for testing
4. Document in README files
5. Test location linking in Logseq
```

Grand Total: 41 properties

Child Classes:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- InfectiousDisease
- MedicalSignOrSymptom
- MentalDisease (Note: Not in template)
- ... 10 more

Template Status:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ MedicalCondition - Not in template
❌ MedicalEntity - Not in template
❌ Medical domain - No dedicated module

Current State:

```
source/medical/
├── classes.edn (MedicalEntity, MedicalCondition, Drug, etc.)
├── properties.edn (medical-specific properties)
└── README.md
```

Option B: Add to misc/ Module
⚠️  Not recommended - medical domain is substantial
⚠️  Would bloat misc/ further

Implementation Plan:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 1: Create medical/ module
- Add MedicalEntity (base class)
- Add MedicalCondition
- Add 5-8 core medical properties

Phase 2: Add related classes
- Drug
- MedicalProcedure
- MedicalTest
- Physician/Hospital (move from misc/)

Phase 3: Expand properties
- Add full medical property set
- Add medical code systems

Effort Estimate: 3-4 hours
Impact: Enables medical/health tracking use cases
